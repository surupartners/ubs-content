Also known as an editorial calendar, a content calendar is a tool to help you organise and plan the content you're going to publish. It helps you align the content you create with your content strategy and helps you plan the when and how of publishing (how often will you publish, through which channels, to which audiences, etc).

It also gives a top-level view of all the content being published over time which is invaluable for strategy alignment and timing. Being able to visualise how your content is distributed throughout the year allows you to:

- plan content around key Fellowship events or important dates;
- see where you have gaps in your content plan, with plenty of warning to line up more content;
- and make sure you have your content ready in plenty of time to publish.

Finally, it's a helpful tool to get your work done. Publishing and communications can be difficult and complex but a content calendar can help the work feel more manageable and reduce the stress involved making decisions around what to write and how and when publish it.

## How to make one
Practically speaking, a content calendar can be anything from a [simple spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FtmTItkUjUFXMB6vhwSaATQo1AoC3yZwqooOQ4UZWHM/edit?usp=sharing) through to a [team todo list](https://asana.com/guide/examples/marketing/editorial-calendar) or even a [professional content planning tool](https://gathercontent.com/editorial-calendar). In our meeting we suggested using a [Basecamp todo list](https://basecamp.com/help/3/guides/projects/to-dos) for your content planning since you already have the tool and it will allow you to get others on the team involved in content creation and governance. If you do use Basecamp we'd recommend setting up a new "UBS Comms" project to keep it separate [from the others](https://3.basecamp.com/3225710/projects).

We'd recommend making your calendar available to the team to demonstrate to those not involved in the editorial process that you have a measurable plan for content, and to make contributors within UBS aware that if they are late in providing information it could delay when content is published.

## What to include

How you design, share, and access your content calendar depends on your particular goals and available resources. But at the most fundamental level, we recommend that your content calendar include the following fields:

- The date the piece of content will be published
- The topic or headline
- Who's going to write it
- The content owner — i.e. who responsible for making sure the content makes it from ideation to publication and promotion
- The current status of the content (updated as it moves through your publishing cycle)

Depending on various factors — your specific goals, your team’s workflow, the formats and platforms you're working on, and the volume of content you will be creating — you may also want to track these elements to help you stay organised and on track over the long term:

- **The channels where your content will be published**
- **Content formats:** Is it a blog post? A video? A podcast? An infographic? An original image? To get more mileage from the content you create, you might want to consider repurposing it into other formats at some point. It's therefore useful to keep tabs on the types of assets you have available.
- **Visuals:** Images are good. Tracking the visual elements you include in your content efforts such as cover images, illustrations, charts, etc. will make it easier to ensure that your work has a signature look and cohesive brand identity.
- **Topic categories:** This helps you discover which topics you already created a lot of content about and which you haven’t covered often enough.
- **Keywords and other metadata** such as meta descriptions and SEO titles.
- **URLs:** This info can be archived as an easy way to keep your online content audits updated, or to link to older pieces of content in the new content you create.
- **Calls to action:** This helps you ensure that every piece of content you create is aligning with your strategic goals.

It’s tempting to include every scrap of information you have but less is more here. List all of the variables/data points you think are relevant to your calendar, then rank them in priority order. Focus your calendar on the top priorities, and consider eliminating the bottom priorities to make your calendar easy to use and maintain.

## Filling your content pipeline

It can be challenging to make sure you have enough relevant ideas to fill whatever publishing schedule you're aiming for. Some content is timely — event updates, new courses published on the Learning Zone, etc — but there are also going to be evergreen topics which you can use to flesh out the spaces in-between. Paradoxically, these are also the sorts of topics which are (a) strategically important in terms of communicating organisational strategy and long-term concepts, and (b) easy to forget about when you're in the day to day since there's no external trigger to publish content on these topics.

To help with this, consider keeping a running list of content ideas within your content calendar from which you can pick items to include going forward. You might want to include information like:

- The topic idea
- The owner of the idea
- The target keywords/categories to which the content would map
- Who might be available/qualified to author the piece
- A time frame for when you will publish it

## Define the purpose

It sounds like common sense, but the first step toward a successful content calendar is defining why you’re creating it. The purpose for your calendar may be a variation on one or more of these common themes (get as specific as possible):

- Improve content quality or relevance
- Integrate content across various channels/brands/business units
- Fulfill user needs (by profile, lifecycle, or topics of interest)
- Align content with business goals/campaigns/events
- Measure/record content success or value
- Allocate resources (human and budgetary) or justify resource needs
- Manage all content creation/curation/maintenance activities

When identifying purpose, don’t forget to think about:

- Who is going to use the calendar and why?
- How will it be shared/used?
- Who is going to maintain the calendar?
- How often will it be updated/shared?
- How will you know if the calendar is working?

As a reminder, from our write-up of the comms meeting in Swindon:

> We discussed how a more organised and coordinated approach to UBS communications would ensure that key audiences would neither be bombarded by communications nor, conversely, hear very little. We noted that these symptoms were particularly acute at certain times of the year and that using a content calendar could mitigate this seasonality by stabilising the communications schedule. It could also help ensure important information is not swamped with less important and that communicated information is spread throughout the year rather than in peaks.

You may also have other purposes in mind for your content calendar beyond those two broad points we discussed.

## Content strategy — putting the tool in context
Note that a content calendar is simply a planning tool. More fundamental to an organisation is a core _content strategy_ which helps you provide the right content, to the right people, at the right times, for the right reasons. Without a solid strategy guiding your content tactical efforts such as content calendars won't help your effectiveness.

A content strategy should touch on these four core components:

**Content-focused components**

1) _Substance_ — What kind of content do we need (topics, types, sources, etc.), and what messages does content need to communicate to our audience?

2) _Structure_ — How is content prioritized, organised, formatted, and displayed? (Structure can include communication planning, information architecture, metadata, data modelling, linking strategies, etc.)

**People-focused components**

3) _Workflow_ — What processes, tools, and human resources are required for content initiatives to launch successfully and maintain ongoing quality?

4) _Governance_ — How are key decisions about content and content strategy made? How are changes initiated and communicated? Who manages content long-term?

Usability.gov has [a good page](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/content-strategy.html) on getting started with content strategy if you want to learn more. I've also recently read ["A checklist for content work"](https://alistapart.com/article/a-checklist-for-content-work) and ["The discipline of content strategy"](https://alistapart.com/article/thedisciplineofcontentstrategy) which I would recommend.
